      Thank you for participating in our study. Your decision data has been securely saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      This study examines decision-making under a Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing
      mechanism, where participants are allowed to choose any amount to pay for a
      product. The primary research question of this study is “Decision-making in
      the absence of fixed prices: How does disclosing a suggested price influence
      customer willingness-to-pay in pay-what-you-want?”. The study was
      initially presented under a general research title, and the specific PWYW
      mechanism was not explicitly mentioned beforehand. This was necessary to
      ensure that participants made decisions without being influenced by prior
      expectations of the pricing model. Your data will now help us understand the
      psychological drivers behind voluntary payments.
    </p>

      research, please contact Le Vo Thanh Tam by telephone at 0984787545, or by
