    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-3">Endowment</h5>
    <p>
      You are endowed with <strong>100 tokens</strong>, and in pay-what-you-want
      pricing strategy, you can decide how much to pay the seller for Product A.

    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-3">Product</h5>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-3">Payoff</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The seller will receive the amount you choose to pay minus the
        production cost.

      <li>
        You will keep any remaining tokens plus the value you derive from
        Product A.

    <h5 class="mt-3">At each session, you will be asked:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you want to buy Product A?</li>
      <li>
        If yes, how many tokens out of your 100-token endowment would you like
        to transfer to the seller? You will receive the product at any cost.
