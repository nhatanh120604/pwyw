    <h4>Payment Information</h4>

    <p>
      In each round, you will earn an income based on your role and decisions.
      Your income is calculated separately for each round and will be shown to
      you at the end of that round.
    </p>

    <table class="table table-bordered text-center mt-3">
      <thead class="thead-light">
        <tr>

          <th>BUYER</th>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Decides to buy the product</td>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      At the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly selected by the
      computer. Only the income from the selected round will be used to
      determine your final monetary payment. All other rounds are for
      experimental purposes only. The selection is fair and transparent, which
      means every round has an equal chance of being chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Conversion rate:</strong> 100 tokens = 50,000 VND. Your final
      payment equals the income from the selected round converted to cash.
