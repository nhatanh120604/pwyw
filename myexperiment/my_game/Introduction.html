      You huhuuuh are about to participate in a multi-round economic game where you will

          You begin this round with an endowment of <strong>100 tokens</strong>.
          Your task is to decide how much you wish to pay the SELLER for Product A.

      In each round, you will earn a payoff based on your role and decisions.
      Your payoff is calculated separately for each round and will be shown to
      you at the end of that round.

      At the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly selected by the
      computer. <strong>Only the income from the selected round will be used to
      determine your final monetary payment.</strong> All other rounds are for
      experimental purposes only. The selection is fair and transparent, which
      means every round has an equal chance of being chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your final payment equals the token earnings from this selected round plus
      the token show-up fee. The total token amount is then converted to VND at
      a predetermined exchange rate. If you have a negative payoff in the
      selected round, the loss is deducted from your show-up fee tokens before
      conversion.
