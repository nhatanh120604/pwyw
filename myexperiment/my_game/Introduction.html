      You are about to participate in a multi-round economic game where you will
      interact with another anonymous participant to trade a hypothetical
      product. The game requires you to make purchasing and pricing decisions
      based on your assigned role and specific pricing conditions. Your take-home earnings will be based on your performance in the game.

      At the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly selected by the
      computer. <strong>Only the payoff from the selected round will be used to
      determine your final monetary payment.</strong> All other rounds are for
      experimental purposes only. The selection is fair and transparent, which
      means every round has an equal chance of being chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tokens are then converted to VND at a rate of <strong>1 token = 200 VND</strong>.
      In addition to your earnings, you will receive a <strong>20,000 VND show-up fee</strong>.
      If your payoff in the selected round is negative, the loss will be deducted
      from your show-up fee to determine your final payment.
